# LiveProject

For my final project at The Tech Academy, I worked with a development team of fellow students on a full-scale ASP.NET MVC Web application in C#. The project used Entity Framework design and Code First architecture. It was a fantastic opportunity to take on legacy code, fix bugs, and add new features.  I saw first-hand how web applications evolve and necessitate the change or removel to code added by previous developers. 

For the Project Management we used the Agile Process of Software Development with daily stand-ups and weekly retrospectives, along with Azure Dev Ops Cloud Software for the service of the project, and Slack to communicate with each other. During this two-week period, I worked on both front and back end user stories. This two week sprint definitely put my skills to the test. It was challenging working on a project that many students have previously modified, plus having the responsibilites as a team member but at the same time rewarding knowing that the code I wrote and took part in making is going to be used in a real-world applicaiton.  Working together as a team and navigating issues as they presented themselves was my favorite part of the coursework.


STORY 1) Modifying The Schedule Controller: 
This included removing unnecessary catagories from the Schedules Controller, adding Job, Person, Start and End dates. Changing the Model, updating the database to reflect these changes and making the necessary changes to the accompanying Views.

STORY 2) Create Company News Modal:
Created a pop-up Modal on the company news partial view, linking it the database and the Company News Page with all the functionality remaining to create, delete and edit the stories.

STORY 3) Fix Roles Properties:
In this story I worked on the seed data Roles of Admin / Manager / Employee to get them to attatch correctly to the databse so that when logging into the website the appropiate dashboards would appear for the correct roles.

STORY 4) List of Shift Times:
I added shift times to the Job Class implementing the necessary controller and front-end changes making it a TimePicker. I also changed the DatePicker for the Schedule to only show the date for DateTime.

STORY 5) Welcome Pop-up:
I created three seperate Pop-up Modals for this story, one for Admins, one for Exisitng Employees and one for New Users with the User name incorporated into the Modal.
